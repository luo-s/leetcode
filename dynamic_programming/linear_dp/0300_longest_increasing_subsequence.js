/*
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly 
increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting 
some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
