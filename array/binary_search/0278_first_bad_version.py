# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
# Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
# Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions 
# after a bad version are also bad.

# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first 
# bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version 
# is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
# You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
