/*
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given 
nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor 
is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both 
p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the tree.
