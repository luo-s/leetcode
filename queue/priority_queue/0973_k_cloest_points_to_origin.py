# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point 
# on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the 
# origin (0, 0).

# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance 
# (i.e., âˆš((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).

# You may return the answer in any order. 
# The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
