-- Table: Queue
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | person_id   | int     |
-- | person_name | varchar |
-- | weight      | int     |
-- | turn        | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- person_id column contains unique values.
-- This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.
-- The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
-- turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.
-- weight is the weight of the person in kilograms.
 

-- There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.
-- Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. 
-- The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.
-- The result format is in the following example.

-- Example 1:
-- Input: 
-- Queue table:
-- +-----------+-------------+--------+------+
-- | person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
-- +-----------+-------------+--------+------+
-- | 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
-- | 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
-- | 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
-- | 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
-- | 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |
-- | 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |
-- +-----------+-------------+--------+------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------------+
-- | person_name |
-- +-------------+
-- | John Cena   |
-- +-------------+
-- Explanation: The folowing table is ordered by the turn for simplicity.
-- +------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
-- | Turn | ID | Name      | Weight | Total Weight |
-- +------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
-- | 1    | 5  | Alice     | 250    | 250          |
-- | 2    | 3  | Alex      | 350    | 600          |
-- | 3    | 6  | John Cena | 400    | 1000         | (last person to board)
-- | 4    | 2  | Marie     | 200    | 1200         | (cannot board)
-- | 5    | 4  | Bob       | 175    | ___          |
-- | 6    | 1  | Winston   | 500    | ___          |
